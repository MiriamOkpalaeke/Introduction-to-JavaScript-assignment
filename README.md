• Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category.

> A language is statically-typed if the type of a variable is known at compile-time. This means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is. Examples are Java, C, C++, FORTRAN, Pascal and Scala.

> A language is dynamically typed if the type is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer can write a little quicker because you do not have to specify types every time. Examples are JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Ruby, Lisp, and Tcl.
